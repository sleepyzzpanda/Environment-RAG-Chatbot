The parameterization represents the dynamics of the mixing in the abyssal ocean arising from the breaking of internal waves generated by the tides forcing stratified flow over rough topography . Diapycnal mixing in the ocean is thought to be one of the primary controls on the meridional overturning circulation and the poleward heat transport by the ocean . The poleward ocean heat transport does not appear to be strongly affected by the mixing in the abyssal ocean for reasonable parameter ranges . The transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current through the Drake Passage is related to the amount of mixing in the deep ocean .', 'A wide variety of aerosols are suspended in the atmosphere . Especially in East Asia , a huge amount of fossil fuel burning aerosols are emitted throughout the year . Further it seems that the characteristics of aerosols change with the season , and hence the influence impact of aerosols over the climate also varies according to the season . This work is based on the Moderate - resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) data and the simulation results with a three - dimensional aerosol transport - radiation model . This result is drawn from both MODIS data and model simulations . MODIS data shows that the sulfate aerosols are much more dominant in summer than those in winter at Beijing which is influenced strongly by fossil fuel burning aerosols . From the present study I can draw such a result in respect of surface radiation budget as the aerosol impact on the reduction of solar radiation is more dominant in summer than that in winter in East Asia .']\n"
